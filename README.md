# Clean Air Hiking
### Overview

Project 1 of the UCLA full-stack Bootcamp created with 3 other cohorts.
We were tasked to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Working collaboratively taught us agile development methodtologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

This website allows the user to find the 10 closest hiking trails near them using their latitude and longitude data. A table appears with the results of the search showing the user: the name, summary, location and air quality of the trail.
